                            "The Power of Habit", by Charles Duhigg.

                                    This book reverse-engineers the word "Habit" and explains how to get rid of bad ones and create good ones, by finding out the habit triggers.

                                     I enjoyed this book because it gave me a deeper understanding on the importance of getting rid of unnecessary things / requirements. 

                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    It shows examples of products that were taking forever to deliver, due to unnecessary bureaucracy and thousands of requirements that were not important. 
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    It teaches us that blockers can be assessed in an Agile manner.

                                <li>
                                   It shows the importance of early planning, to catch the blockers, synchronize every team member/ task, and adapt, like in a Rugby match. 🏈
